    "<h1>Guardrails for LLMs: Safeguarding Data and Securing AI Conversations</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's rapidly evolving ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs), safeguarding the privacy and security of the data we handle is more crucial than ever. As these models become more integral to business applications and services, the need for robust guardrails to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and ensure safe, secure human-AI conversations has never been more prominent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will discuss the multi-layered approaches required to protect sensitive information while leveraging the power of LLMs in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. In RAG applications, this includes preventing data leaks during document ingestion, redacting PII in real-time interactions, or protecting against malicious user intent with prompt and response guards. To demonstrate this, I will be using the enterprise h2oGPTe application.\n",
    "\n",

    "> <b>Enterprise h2oGPTe</b>- an AI powered search assistant designed to transform the way you access and utilize your enterprise data. It leverages the capabilities of Multimodal LLMs in RAG workflows to provide accurate responses from various sources, such as documents, websites, audio files, and more, all while ensuring the security of your data. Please visit https://h2o.ai/platform/enterprise-h2ogpte/ for more info.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the enterprise h2oGPTe Python client to demonstrate these blog post concepts programmatically. In the following steps, we will authenticate and initialize an instance of h2oGPTe.\n",

    "Before we proceed, I would recommend skimming through the key terms such as `Collection` and `Job` in enterprise h2oGPTe for a better understanding: \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Collection:</b> Collection refers to a group of documents of the same type or a use case. It allows you to aggregate documents in one location, which can later be referenced to ask questions using LLMs.\n",
    "- <b>Job:</b> It refers to a process submitted in the h2oGPTe platform to perform a task, such as uploading documents, summarizing a document, or crawling a website.\n",

    "- Redaction during document ingestion\n",
    "- Detecting PII in real-time during input\n",
    "- Scanning for sensitive output responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these stages plays a critical role in minimizing the risk of PII exposure and preventing harmful model outputs.\n",

Select any of the three options in the image below to enable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when creating a collection. You can choose entities of interest for the `Presidio Labels` or `PII Labels` setting. If you select both options, you can leverage the distinct NER sets that each one offers.\n",
